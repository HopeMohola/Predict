    "    - Brief overview of the project\n",
    "In this project, you’ll step into the role of a junior data analyst at CityBnB, a company analyzing Airbnb listings in San Francisco. Your job is to work with a real-world dataset, write SQL queries, and uncover valuable insights to support both business and public decision-making.You’ll explore questions related to neighborhoods, pricing, availability, reviews, and host behavior — all using SQL in a hands-on, practical way.\n",
