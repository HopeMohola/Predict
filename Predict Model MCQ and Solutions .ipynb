    "\n",
    "This option accurately describes hosts whose identity verification status is \"unconfirmed\" and whose listings show `availability_365 = 0`, indicating that their listings are not available to guests any day of the year. This suggests that these hosts are neither fully verified by the platform nor actively renting out their properties, which aligns with the goal of identifying hosts who may affect trust and availability on the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "To arrive at this conclusion, one would query the database to filter hosts with an identity verification status marked as \"unconfirmed\" and cross-reference with listings that have `availability_365 = 0`. This approach helps CityBnb flag inactive or potentially unreliable hosts.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **B)** describes hosts with a \"confirmed\" verification status and full availability (365 days). This reflects active and verified hosts, which contradicts the premise of identifying unverified, inactive hosts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **C)** suggests unconfirmed hosts whose listings are available all year round (365 days). While unverified, these hosts remain fully active, so they do not fit the profile of concern for trust and availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **D)** indicates verified hosts whose listings are never available. Although these hosts are verified, their zero availability means they are inactive, but they do not represent unverified hosts as specified in the question.\n",

From the output, Bedford-Stuyvesant has the highest total reviews (2239), followed by Williamsburg (2067), and then Harlem (1642).

    "\n",
