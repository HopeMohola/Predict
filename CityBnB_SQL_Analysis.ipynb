These hosts may own tens of properties, operate through shell companies, and never even live in San Francisco. Using SQL, analyze which hosts manage the most listings and generate the highest total estimated revenue. To do this, aggregate all their listings, compute the potential annual income (price × availability), and return the top ten. Keep in mind that some hosts may be hiding behind verified profiles or inconsistent naming. Consider how you might approach joining this with external tax datasets (though that step is conceptual)."
